# INFSCI-1520-Final-Project
# ðŸ§  Alzheimer's and Mental Distress: Regional Trends and Implications

This project was completed for **INFSCI 1520: Information Visualization** at the University of Pittsburgh.

We explore how mental distress and cognitive decline affect older adults (65+) across U.S. states and regions. Using CDC Healthy Aging data, we created a series of Python visualizations to analyze spatial trends, year-over-year changes, post-pandemic effects, and national correlations between distress and Alzheimer's-related symptoms.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Mental distress and cognitive decline are increasing, especially after 2020
- The South shows the highest burden of symptoms
- Pennsylvania and West Virginia consistently report elevated distress
- Distress and cognitive decline are **positively correlated**
- Post-COVID shifts suggest long-term mental health effects in older adults
